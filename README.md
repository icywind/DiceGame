DiceGame
========

The game begins with a list of goal slots on the right as follows:

   5 of a Kind (x20)

   4 of a Kind (x10)

   Full House (x5)

   Straight (x4)

   3 of a Kind (x3)

   2 Pair (x2)

   Any 5 or higher (x1)

   Any 2 or lower (x1)

 

On the left side of the playing field is a set of 5 6-sided dice. The dice are rolled in a series of turns. 
At the end of each turn, the numbers on the dice must match one of the remaining unmarked goal slots on the 
right or the game is over.

 

For each turn, the player may roll the dice up to 3 times. After a roll, the player selects which dice should be 
locked before rolling the rest of the unlocked dice. At any time during a turn, the player may select one of the 
unmarked goal slots, if the numbers on the dice match it, and proceed to the next turn. The score for the selected 
slot is the face value of all the dice times the multiplier.

 

The player's grand total at the end of the game is sum of all the goal slots achieved.
